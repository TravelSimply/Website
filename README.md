# Overview

Travel Simply is a website designed to connect friends who are planning on traveling. Users on Travel Simply can view trips their friends are going on that have been made public, and request to join if trips are looking for more people. Friends inside of a trip "group" can additionally choose to invite other people to their trip. Within a trip group, users can select a destination, create a basic itinerary, and break down estimated costs between members. Some of this information they can choose to make public to show other users they invite to their group or who are looking to go on a trip. 

For individual days or weeks, users can set their status as "unknown" (default), travelling, can't travel, or open to travel. This will help people in travel groups narrow down who is available to travel if they are looking for new members.
